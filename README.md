- **Key Skills**:
  - Fine-tune an LLM on code datasets like GitHub repositories or CodeSearchNet.
  - Build a frontend with syntax highlighting (e.g., using React or CodeMirror).
  - Learn to handle token limits effectively.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch/Transformers, React.

### **Level 3: Advanced Projects**
#### **5. Document Understanding System**
- **Objective**: Build a tool that processes PDFs or scanned documents, extracts key information, and generates a report.
- **Key Skills**:
  - Integrate OCR tools like Tesseract or AWS Textract.
  - Fine-tune models for specific document types.
  - Perform multi-modal processing (e.g., combining text and images).
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Tesseract, Streamlit/Flask.

---

#### **6. Multilingual Translation and Summarization**
- **Objective**: Develop an application for multilingual text translation and summarization.
- **Key Skills**:
  - Fine-tune LLMs on multilingual datasets (e.g., Common Crawl).
  - Understand tokenization for different languages.
  - Evaluate performance using BLEU and ROUGE scores.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Gradio.

### **Level 4: Expert Projects**
#### **7. Custom LLM Fine-tuning**
- **Objective**: Train a custom LLM from scratch or fine-tune a large model like GPT-J or LLaMA for a niche use case.
- **Key Skills**:
  - Set up distributed training using libraries like DeepSpeed or Hugging Face Accelerate.
  - Understand tokenizer creation and vocabulary expansion.
  - Deploy large models with optimization techniques (e.g., quantization or pruning).
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch/Transformers, Accelerate/DeepSpeed.

---

#### **8. Real-time Conversational AI Platform**
- **Objective**: Build a scalable conversational AI platform for real-time interaction.
- **Key Skills**:
  - Deploying LLMs with fast inference (e.g., using ONNX or TensorRT).
  - Implementing serverless architecture for scale (e.g., AWS Lambda).
  - Manage multi-turn conversations with context.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, Hugging Face, AWS/GCP.

---

### **Bonus Project for Portfolio**
#### **9. AI-Powered Knowledge Base**
- **Objective**: Create a knowledge base system where users can upload documents, and the system can answer questions based on uploaded data.
- **Key Skills**:
  - Implement embeddings and vector search for knowledge retrieval.
  - Build a UI for document uploads and Q&A interactions.
  - Handle complex queries using fine-tuned models.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pinecone/FAISS, Gradio, Hugging Face.

### **Suggestions for Success**
1. **Learn the Foundations**:
   - Get comfortable with Python and PyTorch.
   - Understand machine learning basics (e.g., overfitting, loss functions).
2. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Document each project well with README files, usage instructions, and deployment steps.
   - Include sample inputs/outputs and links to live demos where applicable.
3. **Showcase Deployment**:
   - Deploy projects on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Hugging Face Spaces for live demonstrations.
4. **Contribute to Open Source**:
   - Contribute to existing LLM-related projects or create your own.
